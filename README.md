## Challenges Faced (Backend)

1. **Role-based Access Control**: Implementing granular user permissions for different roles (admin, surveyor, pro-user, user) was complex.
2. **Survey Creation & Management**: Developing a system to create, manage, and prevent duplicate survey submissions required careful planning.
3. **Payment Gateway Integration**: Securely integrating payment gateways while ensuring user data privacy posed challenges.
4. **Dashboard Implementation**: Creating distinct dashboards for admins, surveyors, and users with tailored functionalities required extensive backend work.
5. **Data Visualization**: Presenting survey results through charts for better understanding was a challenge especially mongoDB aggregation was new for me I took the challenge and i did it .
